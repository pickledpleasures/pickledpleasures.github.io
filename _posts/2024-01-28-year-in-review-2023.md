Lindsay to add her part...


### December 2022

Our usage of 2023 is loose. Communication is difficult like that. The highlight of December was our trip to Paris, and our Paris experience was representative of our year. 2023 was a memorable year of appreciating money saving opportunities and not taking good photos.

Paris has so many beautiful places. Yet, going through our photos, we mainly have pictures of Janet looking at food or trying to get the last bits out of food.

Of course, we went to the main touristy areas and took pictures as well. Attempts at capturing a good moon picture led to 14 photos, otherwise identical but for the blur around a bright white dot.

We also went to hole-in-the-wall restaurants to indulge in wine and oysters, where close-up shots brought out the glamor in focal objects.

Lindsay's favorite food experience was a wine and cheese combo enjoyed in our tiny Airbnb. Getting pastries for takeout from three places and eating them with coffee was a close second.

### January 2023

For MLK weekend, we snagged a flight deal and coordinated with Esha and Kelvin for a trip to Kansas City. At the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Lindsay was fascinated by a display of an artist's daily self-portraits and her account of accomplishments. The artist never noted her portraits as an accomplishment though.

At the smaller Kemper Museum of Contemporary Arts, Janet thought about her job and commiserated with the Crying Giant.

Back at home, we celebrated Lunar New Year x2 with old friends and new.

We also discovered the Maggie Daley Park Ice Skating Ribbon. We bought ice skates and Janet finally learned how to stop, sort of.

### February 2023

At the start of February, Janet made a beautiful cake. Only the successes get a picture taken.

After last year's skiing success, we decided to visit Emily and try a real mountain. Having previously only skied in the Midwest, skiing in Vermont made us feel very inexperienced.

The rest of the month was quiet. Janet started her job search in earnest and committed to developing a few hobbies so she'd stop working so much. Lindsay joined a local orchestra that meets a few blocks away from our condo.

### March 2023

The end of winter is a great time to host. We invited our new badminton friends over for a meal.

There was a processing mistake made on our Vermont skiing trip that led to us getting a free weekend at an Epic resort. Since we had limited time to plan, we thought that we might have more fun trying snowboarding at Wilmot, our local Epic resort (hill). 

In March, Lindsay also started taking up running outdoors. One of us is better at having hobbies. Janet met Lindsay up for food at the end of her run. We also saw the Chicago River dyed green for St. Patrick's Day.

### April 2023

April was a transition month. The weather isn't consistent enough to be excited, and Janet started her new job. Lindsay continued to try to fatten everyone up with delicious food. Hanh and Liam hosted us for Easter and gifted us a bird feeder. It was very exciting to see the house finches come by. Also, our orchids bloomed beautifully.

### May 2023

In May, the city wakes up from hibernation. We went to museums, movie screenings, arts festivals, basketball games, and volunteered for park district trash pickups.

At the end of the month, we snuck in a short trip to Mexico City, where public transportation was delightful and public restrooms were nowhere to be found. We sampled many local fruits and tacos. As is standard for our trips nowadays, we went to the major tourist attractions to burn off our high calorie intake.

### June 2023

Lindsay had been wanting to do an overnight canoe camping trip in Wisconsin for years, and she finally made it happen in June. We went with more capable friends who tried to teach us how to start a fire. There was no picture taken, so you can infer our successfulness. While we were out of the house, we had our interior brick walls tuckpointed. Yay for good planning!

During the rest of June, we watched the Dragon Boat Race at Ping Tom Memorial Park, went to a live storytelling event hosted by The Moth, picnicked at the lawn during Grant Park music concerts, and discovered Trader Joe's knockoff of Supergoop's sunscreen. Janet also had to go through a medical procedure and was pronounced healthy. With such a busy month, we had a low-key dinner at home to celebrate our anniversary.

### July 2023

Over the July 4 long weekend, we've made it a habit to visit Lindsay's relatives in Ohio. Unfortunately, we did not take any photos. We also went on a cabin trip with our ex-Allstate friends in Two Rivers, WI. The only pictures we have from Two Rivers are of mushroomsâ€¦ 

<figure>

Janet has many pictures in this month of failed cakes. The only other picture is a selfie taken at a theater showing of Personality: The Lloyd Price Musical.

### August 2023

Maryland has firmly made it on our happy-to-revisit list of places. Esha and Kelvin picked us up from the Baltimore airport and drove down to our Southern Maryland vacation spot. We caught crabs, ate crabs, kayaked, canoed, found new mushrooms, and had an unforgettable experience with a pufferfish.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/posts/2023/2308-maryland.jpg">
  <figcaption>Crabs and mushrooms in Maryland.</figcaption>
</figure>

The pufferfish experience requires some storytelling: 

Because our main crab pots caught crabs without us needing to actively do much, a few of us (mainly Lindsay) wanted to try their hand at catching crabs in a more primitive manner. While waiting for a crab to come to the bait, a fish swam by. Wanting to show off her abilities, Lindsay tried to close the cage on the fish. The fish should have been small enough to swim through the grates of the cage. But this was a pufferfish that decided to puff itself while going through the grates. The fish got stuck. Lindsay thought she killed the fish and freaked out, dropping the cage to the bottom of the shallow waters where the fish faceplanted and showed a little tail sticking up. 

Janet pulled the cage up to look at the fish. While Esha took a picture, the fish moved, scaring all of us. Then ensued Googling for ways to get a pufferfish to de-puff. Janet decided that the pufferfish needed to burp out air, so she kayaked out to tie the cage into a position for the pufferfish to be upright.

</figure>

  <figcaption>Pufferfish: Waiting to burp.</figcaption>
</figure>

About two hours later, the pufferfish de-puffed itself enough to get through the grates and swim away. This happened too fast for us to get a photo though. During the wait, Lindsay discovered that our pufferfish friend is edible and debated whether she wanted to try to cook it. Janet objected based on the effort put in to try to save the fish. Luckily for our puffed-up friend, Lindsay is often very indecisive.

May this experience serve to remind us that we can be our own worst enemy and put ourselves in ridiculously compromising positions.


### September 2023

We kicked off September with a camping Meetup over Labor Day weekend. The trip started off horribly with our rental car getting towed from our parking lot while we were loading it up with gear. The rest of the trip was okay. We met some very nice people, saw the Starlink train (Lindsay was very upset), and tried whitewater rafting when the water level was probably too low to do so safely. We're still figuring out what types of group trips we enjoy.

With Janet switching jobs, vacation days were scarce in 2023, which we tried to stretch out by taking red-eye flights. Our big summertime vacation was to Glacier National Park. Gorgeous place, but so difficult to get to. The badminton junior world championships happened to be playing in Spokane. During our last day of rain, we opportunistically bought tickets and gawked at a few worldclass matches.

As a month of harvest, we enjoyed bitter melon from Karin's garden and went apple picking with our ex-Allstate peeps.

### October 2023

Kelvin visited Chicago in early October, and we took the opportunity to eat a lot of food, which is a little more than normal.

We took a short weekend trip to Atlanta, where Lindsay ate a delicious blackened grouper fish sandwich.

In Atlanta, we pretended to be children and joined an aquarium sleepover.

Back in Chicago, it snowed on Halloween.


### November 2023

Lindsay and Janet did the Hot Chocolate Run in November. We hit our goal of running 10K under an hour. At the finish line, Janet noticed a photographer and Lindsay did not, resulting in our favorite photo of the year.

Esha and Kelvin visited us in November to prepare for their upcoming move (so excited!). We also visited Lindsay's Ohio relatives over Thanksgiving. Alas, no pictures were taken from either event. We only have pictures of our pumpkin carvings.

### December 2023

December is a busy month with holiday parties and other social gatherings. Despite the challenging logistics, and also because of them, this month always reminds us to feel thankful for the relationships we have.

Lindsay joined Janet for a few days in New York City. While Janet worked, Lindsay took pictures, ate, and walked in order to eat more. Janet was able to join in a few food adventures.

With food pictures, one of us looks good next to food, and one of us makes food look especially good.

On our way back to Chicago, we were greeted by a stunning view of the city.

Between Christmas and the New Year, we went to Costa Rica. For the first half of our trip, we tried kite surfing (hard). For the second half of our trip, we hunted for coconuts (also hard!).
