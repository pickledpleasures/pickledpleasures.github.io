Scenery shots are difficult. The sensation of physically being in an awe inspiring location can’t be replicated through a 2D static image, however nice the camera. My forays into landscape photography amounted to a handful of okay shots and a lot of blurry sunsets and full moons.

This grainy picture though, reminds me of a memory. It’s from when E was in Chicago and snapped that amazing candid photo that was used for the wedding invite. From this blurry moon picture, I remember balancing on rocks, trying to do yoga poses, and feelings of being happy, chilly, and awkward (maybe my mind is filling in some blanks here). 

Not to say that the value of a photo depends solely on linked memories. There are some shots that only a still image can capture.

And there are emotions and stories that can be created when photos taken out of context or through photo editing and post processing.

L likes to travel, probably a lot more than me. For most of our trips, I end up lugging around my chunky DSLR camera. I think it makes me pay attention to things that I otherwise wouldn’t. Plus, as L has determined, I otherwise don’t remember things. 

When I think back, most of my earliest memories are of events where photos were taken. I’m not sure if what I am remembering is the actual time of when the photos were taken or if I am really remembering discussions and thoughts about the photos later. For an individual, does the actual history matter more or the adulterated memory?
